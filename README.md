DE4 Opti Coursework 2019/20: Code Submission
============
This repository is a simple example/shell of how we expect the source code for
your coursework to be submitted. 

Instructions
----------

**All submissions should be via e-mail with link to a git repository that can be cloned.**

**The deadline for source code submission is 4pm on Friday 13th December**

Ensure that your code can be executed to reproduce the numerical (where
deterministic, otherwise explained) and graphical results provided in your
reports at the system and subsystem levels. Please use the following directory
structure:  

Directory Structure
-----------
1. System
2. Subsystem_1
3. Subsystem_2
4. Subsystem_3
5. Subsystem_4 

The System directory should contain all necessary code and files to reproduce
the results presented for the System optimisation (i.e. Group). 

The Subsystem_x folders should contain all necessary code and files such that
the results for the stand-alone subsystem optimisations that you have worked on
individually can be reproduced. 

**NOTE:** The Subsystem_x directories are significantly more important than 
System on an individual basis. Students take sole responsibility for ensuring quality and accuracy of their Subsystem directories.

Executing the Code
----------
Create a README for each of the directories containing the following
information: 

1. List any software/library prerequisites/dependencies needed to run the code
2. Specify the main script 
3. Provide an indication of the typical performance (e.g. execution time, with
indication of processor and operating system)

Open Source or Private 
----------
You have an opportunity to create a web page in support of your project. You may already have a digital portfolio, which you are free to use, or you can simply follow
the instructions to add a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com) if this would be more convenient. 

This has the added advantage of allowing you to showcase your work to the world
and complement your digital portfolio(s). You may use this opportunity to include
any high quality images/CAD drawings or simulations/videos that might not be suitable for inclusion
in your reports.

If you choose to do this, we also recommend that you upload a copy of your final
report to your public repository to place everything in context.

If you would prefer your project to be private, please create a private git repository and provide access to [David](<mailto:david.boyle@imperial.ac.uk>)
and [Michel](<mailto:m.cardin@imperial.ac.uk>).

In the case of a private repository, you may still include additional material
in support of your project.

**NOTE:** You may use *any* git service of your choosing!
